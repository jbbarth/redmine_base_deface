# Little hack for deface in redmine:
# - redmine plugins are not railties nor engines, so deface overrides are not detected automatically
# - deface doesn't support direct loading anymore ; it unloads everything at boot so that reload in dev works
# - hack consists in adding "app/overrides" path of all plugins in Redmine's main #paths
Rails.application.paths["app/overrides"] ||= []
Dir.glob("#{Rails.root}/plugins/*/app/overrides").each do |dir|
  Rails.application.paths["app/overrides"] << dir unless Rails.application.paths["app/overrides"].include?(dir)
end
